#### About
This is a project I made using [Oraclize](http://www.oraclize.it/).

It's a simple HTML/JavaScript front-end that communicates with a [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.23/) Smart Contract to fetch the ETH/USD price from the [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) developers API. 

It uses [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/), [truffle-webpack](http://truffleframework.com/boxes/webpack) and [ethereum-bridge](https://github.com/oraclize/ethereum-bridge).

*A nice and simple example on how to use Oraclize and Solidity Events to create ÐApps.*

I've created this repository as a reference to [my Medium article](https://medium.com/@WWWillems).

#### Tools used
- Solidity
- Truffle, truffle-webpack
- [ethereum-bridge](https://github.com/oraclize/ethereum-bridge)

3. Go to my article and follow allong
4. Run `npm run dev` to start Truffle server
